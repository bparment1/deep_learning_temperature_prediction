# Deep Learning and temperature predictions
Predicting temperature at every location in space is difficult given the sparsity of data on the earth surface. This project aims at improving temperature predictions using temperature based satellite measurements data and deep learning methods. We compared Deep Neural Network methods to classic machine learning algorithms.
